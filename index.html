          <h2>Why Arizona?</h2>
          <h3>Time Moves Differently</h3>
          <p>Beneath the sun-drenched skies and sweeping desert winds, this land holds stories etched in stone and
            silence. From the
            hidden depths of Kartchner Caverns to ancient symbols carved into canyon walls, Arizona is filled with
            places
            that feel
            older than time waiting to be explored, not explained.</p>
          <p>
            Towering above it all, the saguaro stands like a quiet sentinel. Some believe these giants are more than
            just
            plants, they’re guardians of the desert, keeping watch for centuries. In their stillness is a kind of
            wisdom,
            an
            invitation to slow down and listen. Here, the desert doesn’t shout. It whispers if you’re willing to hear
            it.
          </p>

            “The path wasn’t marked, but something pulled her forward like the land itself was guiding her toward a
            story she
            hadn’t heard yet.”

          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Hi! My name is Kristian, the first time I visited Arizona I instantly fell in love with everything my eyes
            could see. Each spring since has felt
            like magic!
          </p>
          <p>
            Cactus flowers so vibrant they look unreal, momma quail leading their fuzzy chicks, and
            landscapes greener
            than you'd expect from the desert. After a long Central New York winter, the sunshine and soul of the
            Southwest are
            exactly the kind of reset I need.
          </p>
